# Caesar-Cypher
An implementation of the Caesar-Cypher Algorithm in Python!

###
Running the Algorithm
###

In order to run the Caesar-Cypher program:

  1) CD into the directory containing the Python file in Terminal.
  
  2) Run the Python file in interactive mode.
  
  3) Input a message and a value to phase-shift by.
  
  4) Enjoy your encrypted message!
  
Currently, the program does not preserve whitespace between string messages. Any string message inputted that has whitespace will be outputted 
without the whitespace.
